/**
 * This annotation is used to mark the request body to an endpoint defined inside a service.
 *
 * <p>Domino rest uses the following sequence to determine the request body for an endpoint:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>if the method does have http method that does not require body, then the body will be
 *       ignored.
 *   <li>checks if there is an argument that may be considered as a request body using the following
 *       sequence:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>if it is a class implements {@link RequestBean}
 *         <li>if it is annotated with {@link RequestBody}
 *         <li>if it is a class annotated with {@link RequestBody}
 *         <li>if it is a class annotated with {@link JSONMapper}
 *         <li>if none of the above matched, domino rest will consider the last un-annotated
 *             argument as a body
 *       </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>Once the request body for an endpoint is determined, domino rest will use
 * <b>domino-jackson</b> to serialize the body if there is no {@link Writer} defined for it.
