# domino-rest

Domino-rest is a lib for generating rest clients from **JaxRs** compatible interfaces, and the generated clients can be used from both client side -browser- using GWT and on the server, the lib works in both **GWT2** and **GWT3/J2CL**, the serialization and deserialization is based on [domino-jackson](https://github.com/DominoKit/domino-jackson), and service definition is based on **JaxRs** annotations, while code generation uses annotation processing **APT**.
